- Thermal support.

- Bifrost support:
  - DT bindings (Neil, WIP)
  - MMU page table format and address space setup
  - Bifrost specific feature and issue handling
  - Coherent DMA support

- Support for 2MB pages. The io-pgtable code already supports this. Finishing
  support involves either copying or adapting the iommu API to handle passing
  aligned addresses and sizes to the io-pgtable code.

- Per FD address space support. The h/w supports multiple addresses spaces.
  The hard part is handling when more address spaces are needed than what
  the h/w provides.

- Support pinning pages on demand (GPU page faults).

- Support userspace controlled GPU virtual addresses. Needed for Vulkan. (Tomeu)

- Support for madvise and a shrinker.

- Compute job support. So called 'compute only' jobs need to be plumbed up to
  userspace.

- Performance counter support. (Boris)
