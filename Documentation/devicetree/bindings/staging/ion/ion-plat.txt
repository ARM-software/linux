ION platform
============

The ION platform driver allows to create ION heaps with a reserved memory as a
back-end.

1) ION node

Required properties:

- compatible : This can be one of the following ION heap types:
    - "ion,carveout"
    - "ion,chunk"
- memory-region:  a phandle to the reserved memory used as a back-end.

Optional properties:

- chunk: chunk size for the ION chunk heap in bytes.


2) ION reserved memory

Required properties:

- compatible : "ion-reserved"
- reg : This property defines the address and size of the reserved memory.

The reserved memory "no-map" option is not supported by this driver.


3) Example:

	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		ranges;

		gpu_protected: gpu_protected@c0000000 {
			compatible = "ion-reserved";
			reg = <0x0 0xc0000000 0x0 0x10000000>;
		};
	};

	ion {
		compatible = "simple-bus";

		protected {
			compatible = "ion,carveout";
			memory-region = <&gpu_protected>;
		};
	};
