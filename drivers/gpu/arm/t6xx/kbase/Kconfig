menuconfig MALI_T6XX
	tristate "Mali-T6XX support"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this option to build support for the ARM Mali-T6XX GPU.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  this will generate a single module, called mali_kbase.

config MALI_GATOR_SUPPORT
	bool "Streamline Debug support"
	depends on MALI_T6XX
	default n
	help
	  Adds diagnostic support for use with the ARM Streamline Performance Analyzer.
	  You will need the Gator device driver already loaded before loading this driver when enabling
	  Streamline debug support.

config MALI_T6XX_DVFS
	bool "Enable DVFS"
	depends on MALI_T6XX
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to enable DVFS on MALI T6XX DDK.

config MALI_T6XX_RT_PM
	bool "Enable Runtime power management"
	depends on MALI_T6XX
	depends on PM_RUNTIME
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to enable runtime power management on MALI T6XX DDK.

menuconfig MALI_T6XX_ENABLE_TRACE
	bool "Enable kbase tracing"
	depends on MALI_T6XX
	default y
	help
	  Enables tracing in kbase.  Trace log available through
	  the "mali_trace" debugfs file, when the CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is enabled

config MALI_EXYNOS_TRACE
	bool "Enable LSI trace"
	depends on MALI_T6XX && MALI_T6XX_ENABLE_TRACE
#	default y
	help
	  Enable tracing in kbase. It defined by S.LSI

config MALI_FULL_TRACE
	bool "Enable FULL trace"
	depends on MALI_T6XX && MALI_T6XX_ENABLE_TRACE
#	default n
	help
	  Enable tracing in kbase. It defined by ARM and work fully.

config MALI_T6XX_DEBUG_SYS
	bool "Enable sysfs for mali t6xx"
	depends on MALI_T6XX && SYSFS
	default n
	help
	  Enables sysfs for mali t6xx device. Set/Monitor Mali T6xx Device

# MALI_EXPERT configuration options

menuconfig MALI_EXPERT
	depends on MALI_T6XX
	bool "Enable Expert Settings"
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this option and modifying the default settings may produce a driver with performance or
	  other limitations.

config MALI_DEBUG_SHADER_SPLIT_FS
	bool "Allow mapping of shader cores via sysfs"
	depends on MALI_T6XX && MALI_T6XX_DEBUG_SYS && MALI_EXPERT

	  Select this option to provide a sysfs entry for runtime configuration of shader
	  core affinity masks.

config MALI_PLATFORM_FAKE
	bool "Enable fake platform device support"
	depends on MALI_T6XX && MALI_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  When you start to work with the Mali-T600 Series device driver the platform-specific code of
	  the Linux kernel for your platform may not be complete. In this situation the kernel device driver
	  supports creating the platform device outside of the Linux platform-specific code.
	  Enable this option if would like to use a platform device configuration from within the device driver.

config MALI_PLATFORM_THIRDPARTY
	depends on MALI_T6XX && MALI_EXPERT
	bool "Third Party Platform"
	default y
	help
	  Select the SOC platform that contains a Mali-T6XX

config MALI_PLATFORM_THIRDPARTY_NAME
	depends on MALI_T6XX && MALI_PLATFORM_THIRDPARTY && MALI_EXPERT
	string "Third party platform name"
	help
	  Enter the name of a third party platform that is supported. The third part configuration
	  file must be in kbase/src/linux/config/tpip/mali_kbase_config_xxx.c where xxx is the name
	  specified here.

config MALI_DEBUG

	depends on MALI_T6XX && MALI_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  This can be used to test the driver in a simulated environment
	  whereby the hardware is not physically present. If the hardware is physically
	  present it will not be used. This can be used to test the majority of the
	  driver without needing actual hardware or for software benchmarking.
	  All calls to the simulated hardware will complete immediatly as if the hardware
	  completed the task.

config MALI_ERROR_INJECT
	bool "Error injection"
	depends on MALI_T6XX && MALI_EXPERT && MALI_NO_MALI
	default n
