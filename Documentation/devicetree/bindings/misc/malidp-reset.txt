* Mali-DP Reset Widget

This node is for a reset widget included in Mali-DP development bitfiles. It
provides an interface to the HW reset lines of the Mali-DP device(s).

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "arm,malidp-reset"
- reg: The register location and length (length should be 4)

Optional properties:
- mask: The default reset mask to use (if not specified, a driver-internal
default is used). This should be a 3-bit number, where the bits have the
following meanings:
 bit 2: Global reset
 bit 1: Primary core reset
 bit 0: Secodary core reset

Example:

	widget0: widget@0x6f020058 {
		compatible = "arm,malidp-reset";
		reg = <0 0x6f020058 0 0x4>;
		mask = <0x7>;
	};
