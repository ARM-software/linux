* ARM Assertiveness Display version 3  (mali-ad3)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "arm,ad-v3".
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers in the system
- clocks: should contain a phandle + clock-specifier pair for each clock
entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: should contain:
      * "aclk": AXI interface clock
- firmware_name: The name of ad3 firmware file,
which can be put in the kernel default firmware path /lib/firmware.
- io-channels: List of phandle and IIO specifier pairs,one pair for each
IIO input to the device.
Note: for ad3, there's only one IIO pair to match the light input from
IIO ambient light spicifier.
- backlight: phandle of the backlight device attached to AD3.
Note: this is required if the platform uses the backlight device as
the backlight control.
- led_trigger: the ad3 trigger assigned to the LED as the default trigger.
Note: this is required if the platform uses the LED as the backlight control.

Optional properties:
- io-channel-names: List of IIO input name strings sorted in the same order
as the io-channels property.
Note: ad3 can use io-channel-names to match IIO input names with the IIO ambient
light spicifier.

Example:

/{
        ...

        ad0: ad@d00000 {
                compatible = "arm,ad-v3";
                clocks = <&dpu_aclk>;
                clock-names = "aclk";
                reg = <0xd00000 0x584>;
                firmware_name = "ad.bin";
                io-channels = <&als 0>;
                io-channel-names = "als0";
                led_trigger = "AD3";
	};

	...
};
