* ARM AFBC ENCODER Unit devices (mali-aeu)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "arm,mali-aeu".
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers in the system
- interrupts: the interrupt line numbers of the device in the system
- interrupt-names: contains the names of the IRQs in the order they were
provided in the "interrupts" property. Must contain: "APU".
- clocks: should contain a phandle + clock-specifier pair for each clock
entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: should contain:
      * "aclk": AXI interface clock

Optional properties:
- iommus: configure the stream id to IOMMU, Must be configured if want to
      enable iommu in aeu. for how to configure this node please reference
          devicetree/bindings/iommu/arm,smmu-v3.txt,
          devicetree/bindings/iommu/iommu.txt

- aeu-axi-burst-length: this is the burst length in bytes that the AEU will use
  for reading data from the AXI interface.
  Allowed parameters are: <4>, <8>, <16>, <32>
  The default value is 32.

- aeu-axi-outstdcab: this is AXI outstanding transcations capability during
  active region. Valid value range 4 - 16. The debault value is 16.

- aeu-axi-arqos: AXI QoS. Valid value range 0 - 15. The default value is 15.

- aeu-arcache: Layer AXI read transcations memory type. Valid value range 0 - 15.
  The default value is 3.

- aeu-axi-ord: AXI transactions generation mode. Value 0 means out-of-order AXI mode,
  value 1 means in-order AXI mode. The default value is 0.

- aeu-axi-awqos: AXI QoS for writing. Valid value range 0 - 15. The default value is 0.

- aeu-awchache: Write-back layer AXI write transcations memory type.
  Valid value range 0 - 15. The default value is 3.

- memory-region: phandle to a node describing memory to be used for the video buffers.
  If not present, the video buffers may be located in anywhere in memory.

Example:

/{
	...

	aeu@6fc20000 {
		compatible = "arm,mali-aeu";
		reg = <0 0x6fc20000 0 0x20000>;
		clocks =  <&fpgaosc1>;
		clock_names = "dp_aclk";
		interrupts = <0 168 4>;
		interrupt-names = "AEU";
		iommus = <&smmu 10>, <&smmu 11>;
		aeu-axi-ord = <0>;
		memory-region = <&aeu_reserved>;
	};

	...
};
