* Co-processor client driver

This node is for a co-processor device which could get data from Mali-DP.

Requried properties:
- compatible: Should be "arm,coprocessor_client".
- reg: the order based at offset 0.

The device node should contain one 'port' child node with one child 'endpoint'
node, according to the bindings defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
media/video-interfaces.txt.
The endpoint has the following required properties:
 - remote-endpoint: The phandle of the 'coprocessor' endpoint of the attached coprocessor master device.

co-processor should be on a simple-bus and its #address-cells is 1 and #size-cells is 0.

Example:
co-processors {
	compatible = "simple-bus";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	cp0: co-processor@0 {
		compatible = "arm,coprocessor_client";
		reg = <0>;
		port {
			cp0_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&dp0_out1>;
			};
		};
	};
};
